# Benchmarking Ingestion of Pandas into QuestDB

## Background
[QuestDB](https://questdb.io/) is our timeseries relational database with SQL
query support. We support a dedicate protocol (called
[ILP](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/)) to ingest millions
of rows per second over TCP.

Many of our users are Python users who pre-process their data using
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes and up until recently, however,
they would have to loop through the dataframes row-by-row in Python and would
see quite poor performance when doing this (mere thousands of rows per second).

We've recently introduced new functionality that iterates the dataframes in
native code achieving significant speedups.

## This Repo

This repository hosts code to benchmark the ingestion rate of
Pandas dataframes into QuestDB using the official
[`questdb`](https://py-questdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Python client library.

The benchmark reproduces and ingests the "dev ops" (a.k.a. 'cpu') dataset from
the [TSBS](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) project over ILP into QuestDB.

The TSBS project is written in Go, and we replicate the same logic here in
Python: The generated data has the same columns, datatypes, cardinality etc.
Scroll to the end of this page to see a sample of generated data.

The data consists of:
* 10 SYMBOL columns (string columns with repeated values - i.e. interned)
* 10 DOUBLE columns (64-bit floats)
* 1 TIMESTAMP column (unix epoch nanoseconds, UTC)

To run these benchmarks, you will need:
* Modern hardware with multiple cores and enough
ram to hold a large Pandas dataset in memory.
* Python 3.10 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
* and a recent version of QuestDB.

You can follow through the setup and the run commands or just scroll down to see
numbers from our benchmark runs.

## Setup

### Python Client

After cloning this git repo:

```bash
poetry env use 3.10
poetry install
```

Note that each benchmark run will delete and re-create the `'cpu'` table.

### Preparing QuestDB

Start a QuestDB instance.

```bash
questdb start
```

## Running

### The hardware we used

The numbers included below are from the following setup:
* AMD 5950x
* 64G ram DDR4-3600
* 2TB Samsung 980 PRO
* Linux (kernel version: 5.19.0)
* Python 3.10.8
* QuestDB 7.0.1
* 12 threads for QuestDB server.
* 6 threads for the Python client in multi-threaded benchmarks.

### Configuration

For this specific hardware, we benchmark with a
[tweaked](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/ilp/tcp-receiver/#capacity-planning)
QuestDB config as shown below. This is done to avoid the server instance
overbooking threads, given that we'll be also running the client on the same
host.

```ini
# conf/server.conf
shared.worker.count=6
line.tcp.io.worker.count=6
cairo.wal.enabled.default=true
```

In addition, we've also enabled WAL tables as these give us better ingestion
performance (specifically ~1.3x faster for single-threaded, and ~1.6x faster
for multi-threaded gains in this specific benchmark suite and described
hardware).

If your benchmarking client and QuestDB server are on separate machines then you
shouldn't need any config tweaks to get the best performance.

The benchmark script assumes that the instance is running on localhost on standard
ports: If the instance is remote or uses different ports you can pass the
`--host`, `--ilp-port` and `--http-port` arguments to the benchmark script
shown later.

Your milage may vary of course, but it's clear from the benchmarks below that
it's worth using the [`sender.dataframe()`](https://py-questdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#questdb.ingress.Sender.dataframe)
API and not looping through the dataframe row by row in Python.

## Results

By implementing the Pandas ingestion layer in native code, we're now ~28x faster
in single-threaded code and ~92x faster in multi-threaded code, including
database insert operations.

Our performance improvements for just serializing to an in-memory ILP buffer are
even better: Single-threaded serialization performance is ~58x faster and ~284x
faster when it's possible to serialize in parallel (when the Pandas column types
hold data directly and not through Python objects).

### Notes
  * Numbers are taken from the runs shown later in this same page.
  * Timings *exclude* the time taken to generate the sample Pandas dataframe.
  * NNx times faster calculated as FAST/SLOW using the MiB/s throughputs.

### Serialization to ILP in-memory buffer

*No network operations.*

### Without Pandas Support (pre-existing `.row()` API)

Before Pandas support provided by the new
[`questdb>=1.1.0`](https://pypi.org/project/questdb/) Python client,
one had to iterate a Pandas dataframe row by row:

```python
with Sender('localhost', 9009) as sender:
    for _index, row in df.iterrows():
        sender.row(
            'cpu',
            symbols={
                'hostname': row['hostname'],
                'region': row['region'],
                'datacenter': row['datacenter'],
                'rack': row['rack'],
                'os': row['os'],
                'arch': row['arch'],
                'team': row['team'],
                'service': row['service'],
                'service_version': row['service_version'],
                'service_environment': row['service_environment']},
            columns={
                'usage_user': row['usage_user'],
                'usage_system': row['usage_system'],
                'usage_idle': row['usage_idle'],
                'usage_nice': row['usage_nice'],
                'usage_iowait': row['usage_iowait'],
                'usage_irq': row['usage_irq'],
                'usage_softirq': row['usage_softirq'],
                'usage_steal': row['usage_steal'],
                'usage_guest': row['usage_guest'],
                'usage_guest_nice': row['usage_guest_nice']},
            at=TimestampNanos(row['timestamp'].value))
```

This was *very* slow.

```
poetry run bench_pandas --py-row --send --row-count 1000000
```

```

```

During profiling, we found out that this was dominated (over 90% of the time) by
iterating through the pandas dataframe and *not* the `.row()` method itself.

### Single-threaded test (New `.dataframe()` API)

The new [`sender.dataframe()`](https://py-questdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#questdb.ingress.Sender.dataframe)
method resolves the performance problem by iterating through the data in native
code and is also easier to use from Python.

```python
with Sender('localhost', 9009) as sender:
    sender.dataframe(df, table_name='cpu', symbols=True, at='timestamp')
```

*Benchmarking code: `send_one` in [`py_tsbs_benchmark/bench_pandas.py`](py_tsbs_benchmark/bench_pandas.py).*

```bash
poetry run bench_pandas --send
```

```

  ILP Buffer size: 4652.50 MiB: 261.04 MiB/sec.
```

### Multi-threaded test (multithreaded use of `.dataframe()` API)

Since we release the Python GIL it's possible to also create multiple `sender`
objects and ingest in parallel. This means that the QuestDB database receives
the data [out of order, but the database deals with it](https://questdb.io/docs/concept/designated-timestamp#out-of-order-policy).

*Benchmarking code: `send_workers` in [`py_tsbs_benchmark/bench_pandas.py`](py_tsbs_benchmark/bench_pandas.py).*

```bash
poetry run bench_pandas --send --workers 8
```

```

    {'debug': False,

## The `.dataframe()` method inner workings

The TL;DR of how we achieve these numbers is by avoiding calling the Python
interpreter within the send loop whenever possible.

Data in pandas is (usually) laid out as columns of contiguous memory.
Each column (series) is accessible either as a
[numpy array](https://numpy.org/), itself accessible via the
[Python Buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html), or
accessible as an Apache Arrow array via their
[C data interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html).
We've done some experimentation to figure
out which Pandas datatypes are best suited to either access pattern and go from
there. We try to avoid copies whenever possible (almost always possible).

We loop the buffers for the series in Cython (which compiles down to C and
eventually native code) and call our serialization functions which are written
in Rust and themselves have a C API. A bit of inlining and link time
optimization and we can get good numbers.

As a bonus, this approach also allows us to release the Python GIL and
parallelize across threads for customers that need that little bit of extra
performance.

If you're interested in the actual implementation, it lives here:
https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client/blob/main/src/questdb/dataframe.pxi

## Pandas Dataframe String Column Choice

We use the `'string[pyarrow]'` dtype in Pandas as it allows us to
read the string column without needing to lock the GIL.

Compared to using a more conventional Python `str`-object `'O'` dtype Pandas
column type, this makes a significant difference in the multi-threaded benchmark
as it enables parallelization, but makes little difference for a single-threaded
use case scenario where we've gone the
[extra mile](https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client/tree/main/pystr-to-utf8)
to ensure fast Python `str` object to UTF-8 encoding by handling the interal
UCS-1, UCS-2 and UCS-4 representations in a small helper library in Rust.
